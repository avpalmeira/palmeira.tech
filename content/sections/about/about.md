Iâ€™m a 32 years old software engineer from BrazilðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· and Iâ€™ve been building software for about 8 years of my life.

As a software developer, thereâ€™s no part of the software development lifecycle that I donâ€™t like to be involved in. Throughout the projects Iâ€™ve worked on Iâ€™ve spent a good amount of time dealing with a variety of aspects of developing a software product, from building user interfaces from scratch and validating features with stakeholders to ensuring software quality with automated tests and constant monitoring. Although I believe that my skills add more value to a product when they are aimed at <u>building a great user experience</u>.

Creating software products that improve the quality of peopleâ€™s lives and that can potentially bring a true and meaningful innovation to the world is what Iâ€™m passionate about. My main areas of interest and where most of my ideas and effort are dedicated at the moment are:

- **Music industry**: new artists struggle to build a career from zero when just a few people are willing to pay to listen to them, buying their music or through streaming services.
- **Digital identity**: associating user identity to their related resources while keeping them private and secure is something that intrigues me and I believe part of the cause that software is so complicated to many people is because they always have to deal with many sign ups, passwords and complex security mechanisms to do the work they want to do.
- **AI delegation**: we all use computers and devices to handle specific tasks. Itâ€™d be wonderful if personal AI assistants that are aware of our high priority tasks and goals could anticipate and handle some of these tasks for us.

Outside of day-to-day work Iâ€™m mostly with my family or studying about technology, investments or productivity. I like to keep myself active swimming, running and practicing Jiu Jitsu. And I also volunteer as a first communion catechist.

Currently Iâ€™m open for full-time and part-time positions, consulting or partnerships. Interested in building something together? <u><a href="/#contact">Send me an email</a></u> so we can chat about it.
