Iâ€™m a 32 years old software engineer from BrazilðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· and Iâ€™ve been building software for about 8 years of my life.

As a software developer, thereâ€™s no part of the software development lifecycle that I donâ€™t like to be involved in. Throughout the projects Iâ€™ve worked on, Iâ€™ve spent a good amount of time dealing with many aspects of building and maintaining a software product, from creating user interfaces from scratch and validating features with stakeholders to ensuring software quality with automated tests and constant monitoring. Although I believe that my skills add more value to a product when they are aimed at <u>building a great user experience</u>.

Creating software products that improve the quality of peopleâ€™s lives and that can potentially bring real and meaningful innovation to the world is what Iâ€™m passionate about. My main areas of interest and where most of my ideas and effort are dedicated at the moment are:

- **Music industry**: new artists struggle to build a career from zero when their creations are mostly consumed for free or through a subscription model that doesn't provide a good enough source of income to make a decent living.
- **Digital identity**: associating user identity to their related resources while keeping them private and secure is something that intrigues me and I believe itâ€™s a big surface of friction in software nowadays where people have to deal with many sign-ups, passwords, and complex security mechanisms to do the work they want to do.
- **AI delegation**: we all use computers and devices to handle specific tasks. Itâ€™d be wonderful if personal AI assistants aware of our high-priority tasks and goals could anticipate and handle some of them for us.

Outside of day-to-day work Iâ€™m mostly with my family or studying about technology, investments or productivity. I like to keep myself active swimming, running and practicing Jiu Jitsu. And I also volunteer as a first communion catechist.

Currently Iâ€™m open for full-time and part-time positions, consulting or partnerships. Interested in building something together? <u><a href="/#contact">Send me an email</a></u> so we can chat about it.
