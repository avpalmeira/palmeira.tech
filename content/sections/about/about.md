Iâ€™m a software engineer from Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·. Iâ€™m 32 years old and Iâ€™ve been building software for about 8 years of my life.

I'm always looking for ways to build great, innovative and meaningful products for the planet and communities around the world. The world is so full of issues (aka opportunities to improve) that I donâ€™t see myself as doing anything else besides working on innovations to address the problems it already has.

As a software developer, thereâ€™s no part of the software development lifecycle that I donâ€™t like to be involved in. From defining product requirements, designing prototypes on Figma, validating them with customers, setting up strategies and roadmap for the product, then building, testing, deploying, monitoring and fixing software in production, all of these things were already part of my work day, some activities more than others depending on the project. Although Iâ€™m generally more involved on the front-end of software products (mainly using <u>React</u>) finding ways to improve their user experience, all of the projects I worked on Iâ€™ve also developed on the back-end (using <u>Node.js</u>, <u>Python</u> and <a href="/#details">a few other programming stacks</a>), building services, utilities, integrations and APIs, and fixing, improving and adding tests to ensure the quality of the software as a whole.

Iâ€™m a very analytical and methodic person, and I always like to plan my day ahead and how Iâ€™m going to handle the tasks that Iâ€™m committed to. Iâ€™m also very mindful of details, bugs and issues that affect user experience and these, I believe, are some of my best skills.

Iâ€™ve been working on a few projects that Iâ€™m very excited to launch them to a large audience soon. You can check out more about them and their progress so far <a href="/blog">here</a>.

<b>Outside of day-to-day work</b> Iâ€™m mostly with my family or studying about technology, investments or productivity. I also like to keep myself active swimming, running and practicing Jiu Jitsu. And on Saturdays I volunteer as a first communion catechist.

Currently Iâ€™m open for full-time and part-time projects, consulting or partnerships.
