Iâ€™m a 32 years old software engineer from BrazilðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· and Iâ€™ve been building software for about 8 years of my life.

As a software developer, thereâ€™s no part of the software development lifecycle that I donâ€™t like to be involved in. Although Iâ€™m generally more involved on the front-end part of the development (mainly using <u>React</u>), I also have a pretty good experience developing on the back-end (using <u>Node.js</u>, <u>Python</u> and <u><a href="/#skills">some other tools</a></u>).

Iâ€™ve been working on a few projects that Iâ€™m very excited to launch them to a large audience soon. You can check out more about them and their progress so far <u><a href="/blog">here</a></u>.

Outside of day-to-day work Iâ€™m mostly with my family or studying about technology, investments or productivity. I also like to keep myself active swimming, running and practicing Jiu Jitsu. And on Saturdays I volunteer as a first communion catechist.

Currently Iâ€™m open for full-time and part-time projects, consulting or partnerships. Interested in building something together? <u><a href="/#contact">Send me an email</a></u> so we can chat about it.
