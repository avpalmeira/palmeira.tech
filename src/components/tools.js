                My experiences with software development mainly involve Frontend
                programming with HTML, CSS and JavaScript using libraries and
                frameworks such as AngularJS, React and Jquery. I also have
                previous experience developing with Java and, more recently, with
                PHP which I've built a theme for WordPress and also a Web based
                management system for a construction company.

                Through this website and some of my personal projects I'm looking
                to build and improve skills related to more modern technologies
                and practices using Gatsby, GraphQL, Node and React Nactive.
                You can check the source code of some of these projects on my&nbsp;
